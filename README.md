<h3>👨‍💻 Coding Journey</h3>

<p align="left">
Since I was a kid, I was always curious about how technology works, as the world became more digital, with things like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and smart devices, my interest grew even more, that curiosity eventually led me into the world of gaming. I fell in love with the experiences that games provided — and one day I discovered that I could actually create games too, this realization changed everything — I knew I wanted to learn programming, I started studying, mostly on my own, and eventually found freeCodeCamp, their courses helped me a lot — they gave me structure, motivation, and confidence. I’m extremely grateful to them and hope that someday I can give back to the community just like they helped me. Today, I’m still learning, still building, and still pushing forward with every line of code.

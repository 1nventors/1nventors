<p align="center">
I'm just a regular guy who has always been fascinated by technology, I love building databases and small projects that I find interesting or fun to try, everything you see here was made from scratch — I always give my best. I hope that one day I can create software or work with data in a way that truly helps people.

<h3>👨‍💻 1nventors Coding Journey</h3>

<p align="center">
Since I was a kid, I was always curious about how technology works, as the world became more digital, with things like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and smart devices, my interest grew even more.
  
That curiosity eventually led me into the world of gaming, I fell in love with the experiences that games provided, and one day I discovered that I could actually create games too, that realization changed everything — I knew I wanted to learn programming.
  
I started studying, mostly on my own, and eventually found freeCodeCamp, their courses helped me a lot — they gave me structure, motivation, and confidence. I’m extremely grateful to them and hope that someday I can give back to the community just like they helped me.
  
Today, I’m still learning, still building, and still pushing forward with every line of code.
